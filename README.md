## Workforce Report
This repository contains the analysis and findings of a comprehensive workforce report. The report explores various characteristics of the workforce in a specific context.

## Technologies Used
SAS (Statistical Analysis System): The statistical software SAS was utilized for data analysis and processing. It provided a robust platform for conducting descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, principal component analysis, regression analysis, and cluster analysis.
## Analysis Performed
1. Descriptive Statistical Analysis: A descriptive analysis was conducted to gain insights into the workforce data. This analysis involved examining the basic statistical measures, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and distribution characteristics, of the variables under consideration.

2. Correlation Analysis: The relationship between variables was explored through correlation analysis. This analysis helped to identify potential associations or dependencies between different workforce characteristics.

3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data and uncover underlying patterns. This technique enabled the identification of key components or factors that explain the majority of the variance in the workforce dataset.

4. Regression Analysis: Regression analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between dependent and independent variables in the workforce data. This analysis allowed for the identification of significant predictors and understanding their impact on specific outcomes.

5. Cluster Analysis: Cluster analysis was performed to group similar observations within the workforce dataset. This analysis aimed to identify distinct segments or clusters based on shared characteristics, providing a deeper understanding of different workforce profiles.
